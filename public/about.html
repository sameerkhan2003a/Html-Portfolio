<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Sameer A Khan, a passionate learner and developer with a strong foundation in software development, mobile applications, and web technologies. I am currently pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at Jain University, Bengaluru, and hold a distinction in Bachelor of Computer Applications from Tumkur University.</p>

<p>My journey in tech has been fueled by hands-on experience and a thirst for knowledge. I enjoy developing mobile applications using Flutter and Dart, as well as crafting web applications with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With a creative and detail-oriented mindset, I strive to create user-friendly and impactful solutions that solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills, I value collaboration, problem-solving, and adaptability. I’ve also been actively participating in workshops, competitions, and certifications, which have sharpened my technical and analytical skills. When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring historical documentaries, listening to informative podcasts, or spending time with my pets.</p>
